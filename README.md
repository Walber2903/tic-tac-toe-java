Remember Java concepts with TicTacToe

## Our classes will be: board, player and movement.

So far I have made the following requirements:
  - Creating the behaviors of the board class
  - Graphical interface in the console
  - Encapsulating the attributes
  - Constructors
  - Game Logic
  - Loop Game
  - Players Creation
  - Moves between players
  - Validating plays
  - Dealing with errors
  - Persistence with local file
  - Polymorphism with/and Interface

Is a simple but complete project to study and remember the core concepts of java.
